Sorting Algorithms Visualizer


This project is a Sorting Algorithms Visualizer built using C++ and the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library. 
It provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms, helping users to understand how different algorithms work step-by-step through animations. 
The visualizer demonstrates the inner workings of sorting techniques by graphically showing the process of sorting a list of numbers.

Features:
1) Visual Representation of Algorithms: The project visually represents the sorting process by animating the comparison and swapping of elements in real-time.
Algorithms Supported: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort,Insertion Sort, Merge Sort.

2) Real-Time Visualization: Watch how the array elements are sorted step-by-step as the algorithm progresses.
